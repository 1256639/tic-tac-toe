[**Live Demo**](http://1256639.github.io/tic-tac-toe)

---

A browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game.<br><br>
This project leverages **JavaScript DOM manipulation** to dynamically create the game board, handle user interactions, and manage game logic.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Board:** Click squares to place your mark (X or O).
- **Turn Indicators:** The current player's turn is clearly displayed.
- **Win/Tie Detection:** Automatically detects and announces the winner or a tie.
- **Restart Game:** Easily reset the board to start a new match.
- **Modular Code Structure:** Game logic and display logic are separated for clarity and maintainability.

---

## Instructions

1. **Start the Game**  
   The game board appears automatically. Player X always goes first.

2. **Taking Turns**  
   Click on any empty square to place your mark. Players alternate turns.

3. **Winning / Tying**  
   The game will declare a winner if three of the same mark line up horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

4. **Restarting**  
   Click the "Restart" button to reset the game and play again.

- Game logic separated from display logic (modular design).
- Interactive, clickable board built with JavaScript DOM methods.
- Responsive feedback for wins, ties, and invalid moves.
- Option to restart the game.

## Technical Notes

- **Built with:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **DOM Manipulation:** All game rendering, state changes, and event handling are done through direct DOM manipulation and event listeners.
- **Modular JavaScript:** Uses module pattern or ES6 modules to separate logic where possible.
